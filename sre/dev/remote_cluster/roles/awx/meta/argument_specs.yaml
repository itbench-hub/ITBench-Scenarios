    short_description: Entry point for AWX configuration validation tasks
    description:
      - This is a collection of validation tasks needed to run the various other tasks.
      - These tasks include verfying the existence of the kOps cli and the S3 bucket where
        the kOps cluster states will be stored and validating the configuration used in the
        other tasks for managing the various clusters.
      - These tasks should be run as a pre-task in playbooks which invoke this role.
