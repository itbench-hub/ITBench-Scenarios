# ITBench for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Financial Operations (FinOps)

**[Paper](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench/blob/main/it_bench_arxiv.pdf) | [Incident Scenarios](./docs/incident_scenarios.md) | [Tools](./docs/tools.md)**

## Overview
ITBench uses open source technologies to create completely repeatable and reproducible scenarios on a Kubernetes platform. A SRE scenario involves deploying a set of observability tools, a sample application, and triggering an incident (referred to as task) in the environment.

While this repository focuses on scenarios, an open-source Language Model (LM)-based SRE-Agent that aims to diagnose and remediate issues in these scenario environments can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-SRE-Agent).

### Structure

This project uses Ansible to automate the deployment and undeployment of technologies to a Kubernetes cluster and the injection and removal of faults.
The playbook run is configured using variables defined in `group\_vars`.

## Getting Started â€“ Deploying an Incident Scenario

### Installing Dependencies

1. Create a Python virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Ansible collections.
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml --force
```

4. Create the relevant environment variable files by running
```bash
make group_vars
```

_Note: These steps only need to be done once upon the initial set up._
_Note: Depending on what kind of cluster setup is needed, further dependencies may need to be installed. Please see the below section for further details._

### Cluster Setup

#### Local Cluster

For instruction on how to create a kind cluster on MacOS, please see the instructions [here](./dev/local_cluster/README.md).
For instruction on how to create a kind cluster on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machine (VM) or bare-metal instance, please see the instructions [here](./dev/local_cluster/README_RHEL.md).

#### Remote Cluster

For instruction on how to create an cloud provider based Kubernetes cluster, please see the instructions [here](./dev/remote_cluster/README.md).

Currently, only AWS is supported. AWS clusters are provisioned using [kOps](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/).

### Running Incident Scenarios - Quick Start

#### 1. Start the Incident Scenario
Run the following command to deploy observability tools, monitoring stack, chaos engineering tools, application stack, and inject the fault for scenario 1:

```bash
INCIDENT_NUMBER=1 make start_incident
```

#### 2. Set Up Port Forwarding
Enable access to the Prometheus and Jaeger dashboards:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8080:80 &
```

#### 3. Access Dashboards
Navigate to the following URLs in your browser:

```bash
# View alerts and metrics
http://localhost:8080/prometheus/alerts

# View traces
http://localhost:8080/jaeger
```

#### 4. Monitor Alert States
The system includes alerts that monitor:
- Deployment status across namespaces
- Service latency metrics
- Error rates across services
- Kafka connection status for messaging components

**Alert Behavior:**
- Default state: `Inactive`
- After a few minutes: `Firing` (indicating fault manifestation)

#### 5. SRE Agent Configuration (Optional)
If using the [SRE-Agent](https://github.com/IBM/itbench-sre-agent), configure your `.env.tmpl` file:

```env
OBSERVABILITY_STACK_URL=http://localhost:8080
TOPOLOGY_URL=http://localhost:8080/topology
```

#### 6. Cleanup
When finished, undeploy by running:

```bash
INCIDENT_NUMBER=1 make stop_incident
```

### Running Incident Scenarios - Step-by-Step Guide
This section provides detailed instructions for each phase of running an incident scenario:
1. **Deploy observability and chaos engineering tools**
2. **Deploy sample applications**
3. **Inject fault/failure mechanisms**
4. **Monitor the outcomes**

#### Step 1: Deploy Observability Stack

Deploy the complete observability, monitoring and chaos engineering toolkit:

```bash
make deploy_tools
```

**What gets deployed:**
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **ClickHouse** - Analytics database
- **OpenSearch** - Log aggregation and Kubernetes events
- **Jaeger** - Tracing
- **Chaos Mesh** - Chaos engineering platform
- **OpenCost** - Cost monitoring
- **Kubernetes Metrics Server** - Resource metrics

##### FinOps Configuration (Optional)
For financial operations (FinOps) scenarios, update `group_vars/environment/tools.yaml` before deploying:

```yaml
tools:
  kubernetes_metrics_server: true
  opencost: true
```

**Additional details:** [Tools documentation](./docs/tools.md)

#### Step 2: Deploy Sample Application

Deploy the default Astronomy Shop application:

```bash
make deploy_applications
```

**Additional details:** [Sample applications documentation](./docs/sample_applications.md)

#### Step 3: Inject Incident Fault

Once all pods are running, inject the fault for your chosen incident:

```bash
INCIDENT_NUMBER=1 make inject_incident_fault
```

**Open-sourced incident scenarios:** 1, 3, 23, 26, 27, 102

**Additional details:** [Incident scenarios and fault mechanisms](link-placeholder)

#### Step 4. Set Up Port Forwarding
Enable access to the Prometheus and Jaeger dashboards:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8080:80 &
```

#### Step 5. Access Dashboards
Navigate to the following URLs in your browser:

```bash
# View alerts and metrics
http://localhost:8080/prometheus/alerts

# View traces
http://localhost:8080/jaeger
```

#### Step 6. Monitor Alert States
The system includes alerts that monitor:
- Deployment status across namespaces
- Service latency metrics
- Error rates across services
- Kafka connection statuses

**Alert Behavior:**
- Default state: `Inactive`
- After a few minutes: `Firing` (indicating fault manifestation)

#### Step 7. SRE Agent Configuration (Optional)
If using the [SRE-Agent](https://github.com/IBM/itbench-sre-agent), configure your `.env.tmpl` file:

#### Step 8: Complete Cleanup

Remove all deployed components:

```bash
make undeploy_applications
make undeploy_tools
```

_Note_: For a full list of `make` commands, run the following command:

```bash
make help
```
